U.S. lawmakers are trying to stifle any hope that National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden will receive a pardon. On Thursday, the House intelligence committee sent a letter to President Obama urging him to treat Snowden as a criminal
.
“Mr. Snowden is not a patriot. He is not a whistleblower,” the letter said
.
The letter was sent amid calls from tech leaders and liberal activists for Obama to pardon Snowden. The campaign, supported by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and celebrities including actor Daniel Radcliffe, argues that Snowden sparked an important debate about government mass surveillance

“It is clear that America’s democracy has benefited from Snowden’s actions,” activists said in an open letter from the group PardonSnowden.org
.
Members of the House intelligence committee disagree. On Thursday, the committee released a four-page summary of a two-year investigation into Snowden that said he damaged U.S. national security
.
“The vast majority of the documents he stole have nothing to do with programs impacting individual privacy interests,” the committee said in its summary. “They instead pertain to military, defense and intelligence programs of great interest to America’s adversaries
.
Russia, China, Iran and terrorists could access the information that Snowden released to do ill against the U.S., the summary said

Of the iPhone 7 online pre-orders during the initial 48 hours of availability, 55% were for the 5.5-in. iPhone 7 Plus; the remaining 45% were for the 4.7-in. iPhone 7. That was the first-ever flip to the Plus size in the three annual cycles since Apple offered a big-screen iPhone in 2014
.
According to Palo Alto, Calif.-based Slice Intelligence, U.S. buyers of the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus two years ago leaned toward the former in a split of 65% to 35%. The gap narrowed last year with the 6S and 6S Plus, when the smaller iPhone 6S accounted for 59% of the total, and the 6S Plus with 41%
.
Slice based its data on a sampling of approximately 4 million U.S. consumers. Those people have opted in to Slice's services or apps -- including the same-named shopper's assistant app for iOS and Android -- or those of partners which license the firm's technology, and so give Slice access to their email inboxes. Slice sniffs through the inboxes, then spots and copies emailed receipts for online orders
.
Apple does not disclose the sales splits between iPhone models -- or the various versions of its other hardware for that matter -- but instead tallies all iPhones into a single number for each quarter
.
Slice's data hinted at a larger gross revenue number for Apple in the U.S. this launch cycle: The iPhone 7 Plus sells for $120 more than the iPhone 7
.
Not surprisingly, Slice's email receipts also showed that the iPhone's new Black and Jet Black colors were the two most popular for pre-order customers, replacing the now-extinct Space Gray, which had been the top choice for the last two years. Nearly half of all iPhone 7 and 7 Plus orders (46% to be exact) were for the Black, said Slice, with another 23% were for the Jet Black
.
Jet Black, a new highly polished finish, has been in short supply, high demand, or both: Apple ran out of that color almost as soon as pre-orders opened on Sept. 9. Currently, a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus will ship to U.S. buyers sometime in November, according to Apple's e-mart, while a Jet Black iPhone 7 will ship three to five weeks after ordering
