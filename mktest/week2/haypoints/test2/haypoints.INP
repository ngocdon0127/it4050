Tesla was awarded a contract by Southern California Edison (SCE) to have the lithium-ion battery storage facility up and running by the end of this year
.
Over the months that it leaked, the storage facility spewed 107,000 tons of methane gas into the atmosphere and forced the evacuation of 8,000 area residents The Aliso Canyon facility had been feeding the network of natural gas "peaker" power plants in the Los Angeles basin. Peaker plants are typically only used to supplement a power requirements during peak demand

For its part, Tesla said that upon completion its system will be "the largest lithium ion battery storage project in the world.
"When fully charged, this system will hold enough energy to power more than 2,500 households for a day or charge 1,000 Tesla vehicles," Tesla said in a blog Thursday Tesla, however, is not alone in being awarded battery storage facility contracts, and while its will be the largest facility upon completion, that title will not be long held

In July, Tesla Motors announced that it is morphing from being just an all-electric car maker to being a clean energy corporation. In August, the company announced it was acquiring SolarCity, which was founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his two cousins and is one of the nation's largest solar installers. Musk is also the chairman of SolarCity and a majority stockholder
